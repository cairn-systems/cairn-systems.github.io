				<h1>Past Work</h1>
				<p>Cairn Systems has been involved with <a href="http://case.edu" target="blank">Case Western Reserve University</a> working to build models of DC electric power systems and design both centralized and distributed control algorithms for these systems. We are also working with CWRU on developing a mechanism to allow software agents operating within <a href="http://jade.tilab.com/" target="blank">JADE</a> (JAVA Agent DEvelopment Framework) to utilize <a href="http://ab.rockwellautomation.com/Programmable-Controllers/ControlLogix" target="blank">Allen-Bradley PLCs</a> as control effectors.</p>
				<h2>Biography: Ryan May</h2>
				<p>Cairn Systems is currently a part-time endeavour of Ryan May. I am a controls engineer that has spent time in automotive, aircraft, and space fields developing models and control systems.</p>
				<p>I spent three years at <a href="http://www.bendix.com/en/" target="blank">Bendix</a> working on teams to develop, test, and service roll and yaw <a href="http://youtu.be/A90j9lJfArw?list=PLKdGMpxnIG-R1kJdjSGkg21XG4-2Pp0_S" target="blank">stability systems</a> for commercial vehicles. I developed models for hardware-in-the-loop testing and data analysis in addition to developing an executing test methodologies to tune and validate proper system performance.</p>
				<p>I then became a contractor at NASA Glenn Research Center where I first worked in aeronautic systems. I was the lead software developer for the <a href="http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/cdtb/software/mapss.html" target="blank">C-MAPSS40k</a> engine simulation and brought much of that experience to the development of <a href="https://github.com/nasa/T-MATS" target="blank">T-MATS</a>, an open-source Simulink toolbox for the simulation of thermodynamic systems. I also worked on projects involving integrated flight and propulsion control, enhanced propulsion control for improved aircraft safety, and developed some initial proof-of-concept methods to detect the accretion of ice crystals within aircraft engine compression systems.</p>
				<p>I then moved to the space side of NASA and have been developing an autonomous control system capable of operating a modular spacecraft's electric power system. This work has focused on the use of software agents for distributed control and decision making.</p>
